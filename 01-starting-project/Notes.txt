Key concept about JSX
Name Starts with uppercases Character
The function name must start with uppercase charactes
Multi-word names should be written in PaScal Case (e.g "MyHeader)
Its recommended to pick a name that describes the UI building block
 ("hEADER" MyHeaderBloc)

 The function returns a value that can be renderable content
 the function must return a value that can be rendered
 ("Displayed on a screen") by react
 in must cases REturn a JSX
 Also allowed: string, number, boolean, null , array of allowed values


 - React componen are jut s JS script functions


 Built in components:
-start with lowercase character
 -only valid officualy validated HTML elements are allowed
 -Are rendered by react i.e (displayed in the screen)

 Custom Components
 -Name starts with uppercase characters
 -Defined by you "wraps" build in or other custom components
 -React "traverses" the component three until it has only one build in 
 components left


 The propurse of JSX:
 It allows you to define the target HTML code inside the components


 JSX code is used to define a Target UI /HTML code

 What does React do with the Components you use in  the JSX code?
 A: It derives a component tree thats used to perform commands that update 
 the web site DOM 



 1Set Props(APP Component) 
 Props are "custom HTML attributes" set on components
    <coreConcept
     title="components"
     description="Core UI Building blocks"/>
2 Merge into an object
    React Merges all props into a single object
    {
        title:'components',
        description:'core UI'
    }
    
3   Props are passed to a compponent function 
    as the first argument by react

    function coreConcept (Props){
        return <h3>{props.title}<h3>;
    };
