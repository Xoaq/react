Key concept about JSX
Name Starts with uppercases Character
The function name must start with uppercase charactes
Multi-word names should be written in PaScal Case (e.g "MyHeader)
Its recommended to pick a name that describes the UI building block
 ("hEADER" MyHeaderBloc)

 The function returns a value that can be renderable content
 the function must return a value that can be rendered
 ("Displayed on a screen") by react
 in must cases REturn a JSX
 Also allowed: string, number, boolean, null , array of allowed values


 - React component are just s JS script functions


 Built in components:
-start with lowercase character
 -only valid officialy validated HTML elements are allowed
 -Are rendered by react i.e (displayed in the screen)

 Custom Components
 -Name starts with uppercase characters
 -Defined by you "wraps" build in or other custom components
 -React "traverses" the component three until it has only one build in 
 components left


 The propurse of JSX:
 It allows you to define the target HTML code inside the components


 JSX code is used to define a Target UI /HTML code

 What does React do with the Components you use in  the JSX code?
 A: It derives a component tree thats used to perform commands that update 
 the web site DOM 



 1Set Props(APP Component) 
 Props are "custom HTML attributes" set on components
    <coreConcept
     title="components"
     description="Core UI Building blocks"/>

2 Merge into an object
    React Merges all props into a single object
    {
        title:'components',
        description:'core UI'
    }
    
3   Props are passed to a compponent function 
    as the first argument by react

    function coreConcept (Props){
        return <h3>{props.title}<h3>;
    };   


    Good job!
That's the right choice. T
he error is subtle but this example does NOT use object destructuring. 
So here, the "priority" prop is not pulled out of the props object. 
Instead, it's now the entire props object that's named "priority". 
This wouldn't be a problem since the name is up to you.
 But it's now the entire object that's output in the paragraph, not the "priority" property. 
 Therefore, the output would not be "Priority: 5" but instead "Priority: [Object object]" (or something like that).      

The special childrn prop
Content for children
The conten beetween open and closing tags is used as value 
 for the special children "prop"


App Component
<modal>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>Do you want to delete this file? </p>
</modal>

NOTE:
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>Do you want to delete this file? </p> 

this tags will be takes as compoennt by react wich will be interpretated as {props.children} in the modal component 

Modal component

function modal component

function modal (props){
return <div id="modal"> {props.children}</div>;
}

The lesson above described is component composition

Starts with "on"
because that's another convention you'll see a lot 
that should in the end receive a function
that will be triggered upon an event, should start with on.
Starting with   on here makes it clear 
that this prop should be set to a function that will ultimately be triggered based on some event,
whatever event might be It can be a click on some internal button, but it could also
 be some HTTP request that finished, anything you need.
